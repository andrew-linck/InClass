# Nested Data II

## Instructions

Dealing with complex data is a crucial skill so we are going to get a little more practice. In this challenge you can't see the data structure in your JavaScript file. It's coming from somewhere external. 

This may feel contrived but when you are recieving data from a database, you won't be able to see the actual data source. You'll have to rely on `console.log`. 

In `app.js` we are using `console.log` to print some unknown data to the console. 

Navigate the data and find the phrase `you found me!`.

Once you've found the property that matches that value, use `console.log` to print it.

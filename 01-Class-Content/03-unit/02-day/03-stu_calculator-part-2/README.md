# jQuery Calculator II 

## Instructions

Finish creating your jQuery Calculator! As a reminder, the instructions are below:

Create the JavaScript logic necessary to add functionality to the jQuery Calculator.

Your calculator should be able to handle basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.

You should be making use of the existing buttons.

You should be making use of the existing placeholders for entering content (i.e. "firstNumber", "operator", "secondNumber", "result").

This is a challenging activity which means if you get it done, you are a King of jQuery. If you don't, no sweat. The important thing is that you learned at least a FEW things along the way.

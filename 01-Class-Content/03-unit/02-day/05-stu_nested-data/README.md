# Nested Data

## Instructions

Suppose we have a todo list application with data structured like the data in the starter file. We need to be able to get specific data to manipulate it or print it to the screen. 

Navigate the todoList to accomplish each of the following:

1. Use jQuery to append `apple` to the `#groceries` div.

2. Use jQuery to append `pick up art supplies` to the `#errands` div. 

3. Use jQuery to append `diet coke` to the `#groceries` div. 

4. Use jQuery to append `hair appt  at 2:15pm` to the `#calendar` div. 

5. Update the time to `submit expense report` to `8:30am` and append the results to the `#calendar` div.

6. Add a task of `mow lawn` with a time of `5:30pm` to the `personal` array in `dueToday`. 

7. Render all time tasks due today to the `#calendar` div.

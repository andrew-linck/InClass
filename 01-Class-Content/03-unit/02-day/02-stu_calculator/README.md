# jQuery Calculator

## Instructions:

Create the flowchart necessary to add functionality to the jQuery Calculator.

Your calculator should be able to handle basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.

You should be making use of the existing buttons as well as the existing placeholders for entering content (i.e. "firstNumber", "operator", "secondNumber", "result").

This is a challenging activity and you should have fun and push yourselves! We're going to continue working on this activity after break, so if you don't finish, don't worry!

# External Libraries

## Instructions

In this activity, you'll host your DOM Manipulation library on GitHub. 

1. Create a new repository on GitHub.

2. Clone the repository to your computer and add a copy of your `dom.js` file. 

3. `add`, `commit`, and `push` your changes. 

4. Use GitHub pages to host your site. Tack `dom.js` on to the end of the published site URL and make sure you can see your `dom.js` code in the browser. 

5. In `activities/02-inst_ext-lib/project`, add this URL in the `index.html`.

6. Open `index.html` in your browser. Check to see that `You did it!` prints to the page. 

7. Use a few more functions from your library to make sure it works.

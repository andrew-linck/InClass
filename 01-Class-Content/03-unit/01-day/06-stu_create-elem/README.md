# Creating Elements

## Instructions

Using the starter code, add the missing code such that your JavaScript generates HTML content that displays all of the drink options.

**HINT:** You will need a for-loop. Inside your for-loop you will need to: create a new element, set the html of each new element, and append the new element to the page.

## Challenge

Instead of using a `for loop`, try looking up the jQuery `.each()` method and implementing it in place of the `for loop`. You can find the documentation here: <https://api.jquery.com/each/>

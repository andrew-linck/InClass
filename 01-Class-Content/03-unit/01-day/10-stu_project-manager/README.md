# Project Manager

## Instructions

Working in groups, complete the code for the project organizer activity such that:

1. JavaScript dynamically generates buttons for each of the projects on the screen.

2. Clicking any of the buttons leads the selected project to be displayed on the project area.

3. Hitting the clear button erases all of the projects from the project area.

NOTE: This is a challenging exercise. You may want one person to type, while the other two watch over to catch bugs and/or research necessary snippets.

## Challenge

Using the challenge starter code, write a program that does all of the following:

1. Generate a random color string (ie, "green" or "blue") that is displayed in a random color. We'll call this the current color.

2. Generate a list of random color strings that are also displayed in random colors. We'll call this the color list.

3. The user must click the name of the color in the color list that matches the color of the current color.

4. Make an alert telling the user whether they chose correct or incorrect.
5. After the alert, the game should reset.

Checkout the included gifs to see how the game should work.

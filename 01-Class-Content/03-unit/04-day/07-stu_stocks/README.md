# Final Stock App

## Instructions:

Now that we've tied together dynamic button creation and firing off an API call on a button click, let's start to construct a more presentable way to display the data being returned to us from the API so that users of our application don't get confused.

Using either version of the starter code provided to you, complete the application so that various snippets of information about your company are displayed underneath. As a suggestion, display at least each of the following:

1. Company Name

2. Stock Symbol

3. Latest Price

4. News Article Summary

## Challenge

Use the challenge starter code to complete this task instead of the standard.

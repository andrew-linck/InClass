# Trading JSON Dump

## Instructions

Your task is to create an application that looks up stocks and fires off an API call when the user clicks the `Submit` button. You'll later incorporate other elements and stylize, however, for now we just want to test and make sure that we are able to retrieve the data.

Using `app.js` as starter code, add functionality such that clicking `Stock Search` triggers an AJAX call to the iexTrading API and the JSON response to be appended onto the page.

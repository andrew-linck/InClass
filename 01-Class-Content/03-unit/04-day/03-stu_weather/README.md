# The Weather in San Francisco

## Instructions

You are being tasked with creating a weather information gathering widget that will allow the user to retrieve wind speed, humidity, and temperature. We'll first start off by hard-coding in the location as San Francisco.

Using either the starter code or the challenge as a starting point, add in the missing code necessary to accomplish the following:

1. Query the [OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/api) for the current weather data on San Francisco.

2. Log the retrieved data from this query to console.

3. Parse the retrieved data to display wind speed, humidity, and temperature information into the HTML.

**HINT:** You will need to request an API key from the website.

## Challenge

Complete the above activity without using any starter code.

**NOTE:** Don't worry if this feels hard. Push yourself!

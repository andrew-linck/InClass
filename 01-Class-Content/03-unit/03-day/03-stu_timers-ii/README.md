# Timers II

## Instructions

Now that we're getting the hang of things happening asynchronously, let's try a tougher one. 

This is similar to the last exercise, but like last class, we are now getting our data from somewhere else and can't see it until it arrives. 

Use a loop to get all the movies from the incoming data after 1 second. Append each movies to a string surrounded by paragraph tags. Your string should look something like `<p>the matrix</p><p>the godfather</p>`.

Once you have all the names, add a render function that renders the whole string to the page.

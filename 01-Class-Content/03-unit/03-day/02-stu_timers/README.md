# Timers

## Instructions

The activity mimics waiting for a database response before we gather up the relevant data and render it to the page.

Use a loop to get all the names from the friendList after 3 seconds. Append each name to a string surrounded by paragraph tags. Your string should look something like `<p>Sally</p><p>Jim</p>`.

Once you have all the names, use the render function to render the whole string to the page.

# Advanced JavaScript Review

**Instructions:**
Before proceeding with new concepts in web development, we want to stress the importance of understanding the trickier parts of JavaScript. Throughout the rest of your coding career, you'll see scope issues and navigating deeply nested data a common occurence.

### Nested Data Scavenger Hunt

Open `activities/04-stu_review/unsolved/review_1`

Working with a partner, walk through the deeply nested data set and successfully find and log out the items on the following list:

1. Timothy
2. Gold
3. NBC
4. TEKsystems

### Scope Quiz

Open `activities/04-stu_review/unsolved/review_2`

Working with a partner, write inside of the comments what you believe will log out to the terminal. It's okay to get it wrong so long as you and your partner discuss _why_ the answer is what it is. Do not copy the code into your browser before hand! This is your chance to really push yourself.

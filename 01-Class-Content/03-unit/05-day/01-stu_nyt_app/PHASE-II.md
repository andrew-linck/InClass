# NYT Search App - Phase II

## Instructions

1. Create very simple HTML and JS file. Test that these are linked by using a console.log on the js file. If you don't see the console.log, troubleshoot with your teammate! 

2. Use the working URL from the last phase to create an AJAX call and console log the response!

3. Now that you have your response being logged, console log the individual items you need from your response (title, author, etc). 

4. Be sure to test and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.

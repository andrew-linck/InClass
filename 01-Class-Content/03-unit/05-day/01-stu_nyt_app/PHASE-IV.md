## Instructions:

You've done great so far, now it's time to work a little more independently. Here's a high level overview of what you should accomplish in this final phase:

* Alter the AJAX request to use user input
* Render the results to the page
* Style however you and your teammate want and have fun!! 
* Do not forget to test and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
* Once you're done, deploy to github pages. Test and troubleshoot after deployment! 

Great work today!!!

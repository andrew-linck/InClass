# NYT Search App - Phase I

## Instructions:

Choose one member to be the driver, and another to be the navigator. As you work today, you will swap these roles between you.

Checklist:

1. Using the demo as a guide, write down all of the criteria you need to make the search. Do you need dates? Keywords? Names? Once your team has decided on the criteria needed, move on to creating the URL. 

2. Now, understand what the format of the URL should look like to make an Article Search Call by looking at the `REQUESTS` examples at the bottom of the [documentation's README](http://developer.nytimes.com/article_search_v2.json#/README). 

3. Test your URL in the browser and use your own API key to hit the necessary URL. Your API key will replace the placeholder #'s in the examples. 

4. Be sure to test and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.

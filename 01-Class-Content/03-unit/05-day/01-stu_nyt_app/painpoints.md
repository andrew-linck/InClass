# Pain points

* Nebulous deliverables for each section
* We haven't given really solid collaboration skills
	* Difficult to guide teams on task breakdown
* Difficult as instructor to know how best to help
* Not enough intruction on $.params stuff
* Not enough on the iterative process
	* Small problems moving to larger problems

Maybe swap mini-project from next week with NYT?

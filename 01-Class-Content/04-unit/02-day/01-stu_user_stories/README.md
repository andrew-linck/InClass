# MVP User Stories

## Instructions

Discuss together some user stories for your project

Come up with at least 3 user stories

Remember, your MVP should be the absolute *minimum* product that you need to pitch your idea to investors (or your classmates). Think bare essentials.

As an example, the user stories based on the MVP of an instagram-like application might look like:

  1. As a user, I want to post pictures so that I can share my life.
  2. As a user, I want to be able to search for other users so that I can find their list of Images.
  3. As a user, I want to be able to view other people's Images so that I can keep up with what's happening in their lives. 

## Challenge

If you finish early, try to come up with more than 3 user stories.  Is there anyway you can break up your current stories into smaller pieces?

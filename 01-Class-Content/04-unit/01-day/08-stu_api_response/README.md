### Get a Response

## Instructions

*   Now that your group has selected a project idea and know what the MVP will look like, let's get a response to the API call.

*   Take this time to sign up for any API keys you might need, go through the respective API documentation(s), build a query URL, and retrieve a JSON response. 

*   Completing this task will make development of your project far easier as your group will know exactly what types of data will return, and how you can start to visualize what your application will look like.

*   Do this for every API your group intends on using based on the MVP.

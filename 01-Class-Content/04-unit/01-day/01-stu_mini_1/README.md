# Mini Project I

## Instructions:

To complete our mini-project, we need to use 2 APIs. The first takes in a country name and gives us back a lot of data. The data that we are concerned with is the `alpha2code` code for the country.

#### REST Countries:

Read the documentation `https://restcountries.eu/` for the REST countries API.

Test query URLs by simply pasting them into the address bar in Chrome.

Find a query URL that gives you the information on Mexico.

Look through the data and discuss with your group how you would access the alpha-2 code.

#### Open AQ:

Read the documentation `https://docs.openaq.org/` for the Open Air Quality API.

Test query URLs by simply pasting them into the address bar in Chrome.

Find a query URL that gives you the latest measurements for Mexico (Note that you will need the 2 character alpha-2 code from the REST Countries API).

Look through the data and discuss with your group how you would access the `pm10` measurement for each location.

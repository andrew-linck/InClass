# Create Merge Conflict

## Instructions

Have the owner of the repository push a file called `conflict.js` with some random JavaScript code inside of it to master.

Every other member of the group should also create a file called `conflict.js` locally, and also add code to that file.

Then proceed to `git add -A`, `git commit -m "<MESSAGE>"`, and do a git pull to forcibly cause a merge conflict.

# Express Routing

## Instructions:

First, confirm your `server.js` file is working.

This means figuring out: what dependencies to install, how to run the file, and how to view the resulting website in your browser. This step requires you to make ZERO changes to the code file. At this point, you are just getting the file you are given to run.

Then, once you've gotten the original code to display in the browser, create a new `raj` route to display Raj Burman's information. Use the comments and the previous code in the file as a guide.

## Challenge

Once you've completely added the new route, take a good look at the code that's been written. There's a good bit of repetition going on, with only variable names changing. How would you go about `DRY`ing up this code?

_HINT_: Google about URL parameters in express and how you might use them.

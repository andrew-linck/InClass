# Serving HTML

## Instructions:

Create a personal website with four routes:

* Home
* Favorite Food
* Favorite Movies
* Favorite CSS Frameworks

Each route should be triggered by a different URL and should display an HTML page listing your favorite three things of each. Be sure to use `path` to serve your HTML files from the correct directory.

Feel free to add additional pages

## Challenge

Dress up your HTML pages using a CSS framework like Bootstrap.

_Note:_ If you want to apply custom styles, write them in a `<style>` tag in the head of your HTML document for now. Trying to link a custom stylesheet will not work without adding some extra code to our server file.

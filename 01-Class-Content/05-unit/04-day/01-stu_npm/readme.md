# NPM Demo

## Instructions

Create a file called `node-demo.js` somewhere on your computer.

Import in a simple NPM package (something like `axios`)

Write code using that package and log the result to your console. You can use an old activity for this part if you like.

Create a `package.json` file (i.e. run `npm init`)

Add your dependencies to the `package.json` file (`npm install <package>`)

Confirm that your `node_modules` directory was created and that your `package.json` was updated to include your dependencies.

Run `node-demo.js` and confirm that it works as intended.

## Challenge

If you still have time, look at the NPM website <https://www.npmjs.com/browse/star> and try to find a new package that you haven't previously used to include in this project.

Import it and add it to the `package.json`

# Parameters

## Instructions

Add the code necessary to make our route function so that it responds with the JSON of the object whose `routeName` matches the `:employee` parameter.

If no object matches that `routeName` respond with `res.json(false)`.

_Hint:_ Remember that we can send JSON using `res.json`, and that we often use a for-loop to interact with arrays.

## Challenge

See if you can try to find a different way to find and return the requested object than using a for-loop. There are multiple ways you can do this!

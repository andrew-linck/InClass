# Express Server

## Instructions

Using the previous example as a guide, create an app that can serve data on multiple routes:

* `/` should display to the client `Thank you for visiting our site!`
* `/author` should display `This was written by <YOUR NAME>`
* `/date` should display `Today's date is <TODAY>`

## Challenge

Write the code such that the date displayed in `/date` is always the current date, not hard-coded to today's date

# Meetings

## Instructions

Create a file called `meetings.js` somewhere on your computer.

Inside the file use JavaScript to log the words: "I love meetings that should have been an email." (or hate. You choose.)

Then run the program using Node in your terminal/bash window.

Confirm that it logged the text as you would expect.

## Challenge 

If you and your partner finish early, try creating a variable in your file and logging the variable to the console.

Create two variables that each hold a number, then console.log the sum of the numbers.

# Calculator

## Instructions

Do the following using the starter code that has been provided for you.

Create a command-line node application that prints the values of arithmetic operations like the below:

```
The value of x is 3 and the value of y is 4
The sum of 3 and 4 is 7
The difference of 3 and 4 is -1
The product of 3 and 4 is 12
The quotient of 3 and 4 is 0.75
The remainder of 3 divided by 4 is 3
The value of 3 raised to the 4 power is 81
```

The code for `calculator.js` has been provided for you.

Write a function for each of the operations in the `operations.js` file.

Export these functions as properties on an object using `module.exports`

## Challenge

Enable your calculator application to also handle the below case:

`Given 3x+2=8, x is equal to 2`

(Hint: Assume the algebra will always be in this exact form and will always be addition)

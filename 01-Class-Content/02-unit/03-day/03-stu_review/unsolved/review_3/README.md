# Review Activity 3: JavaScript Variables, Alerts, Prompts, and Conditionals

## Instructions

1. Grab a user input using a `prompt()` and store it in a variable. 
2. Add a conditional statment where if the variable's length is greater than `4`, we alert the user that their name is greater than four characters. 
3. Otherwise, alert that their name is less than four characters.

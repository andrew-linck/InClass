# More Functions Activity

## Instructions:

Open your editor and create a file named `function.js`.

In this activity we will create 3 functions.

1. Our first function will accept 1 parameter (a number) and multiply it by itself and return the new value.
2. Our next function will accept 2 parameters (both strings: a first name and a last name) and return the name in the following format: lastName, firstName. 
  * e.g. given the arguments ("Arya", "Stark"), the function should return "Stark, Arya".
3. Our last function will accept 1 parameter (number) and return a boolean: true if the number is even, and false if the number is false.

Be sure to call all of your functions after defining them and log all of your results in the console.

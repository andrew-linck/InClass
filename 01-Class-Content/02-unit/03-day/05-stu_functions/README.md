# Functions Activity

## Instructions

Start by creating a new function called `multiplyFunc`.

`multiplyFunc` should take in one parameter. 

Within the code block, you should simply console log out the parameter.

Finally, call your function passing in any argument you wish.

## Challenge

Re-write the `multiplyFunc` so that it will console log the taken parameter multiplied by `3`.

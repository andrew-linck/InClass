# Conditionals Activity

We're building an application to allow a student to track their classes each semester. Students need to be able to update their list of classes in case they change one midway through the semester.

## Instructions

Using the given `classList` array: 

1. Prompt the user for the name of a class they would like to update.
2. Prompt the user for a new class name.
3. Replace the old class name with the new one.

## Challenge:

Do the above without writing a for loop.

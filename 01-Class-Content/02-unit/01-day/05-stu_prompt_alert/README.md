# Prompt & Alert

## Instructions:

In this activity we will collect some information from the user using prompt and confirm dialogues, and alert the information back at the user.

Update the `script` tag in `index.html` file using `prompt` to collect the following information from the user:

1. Their name
2. Their email address
3. A password (should be fake)

Store each value inside of a variable. Once each value has been collected, use an alert dialogue to display all of the information back to the user.

## Challenge:

Use the [confirm dialog](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javascript/javascript_dialog_boxes.htm) to ask the user if they would like their login credentials to be remembered.

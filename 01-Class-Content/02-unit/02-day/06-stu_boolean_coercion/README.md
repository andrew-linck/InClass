# Boolean Coercion

In this activity we will use boolean coercion to determine if a value has been supplied to a variable.

**Instructions:**

Study the JavaScript code inside of the `script` tags.

Without using the equality comparison operator (`===`) what could you write inside the parentheses for the `if` statement to check if the user has supplied a value to `age`?

**Hints:**

Run the code and when prompted for an age, press enter without inputing anything and try to log the type and value of age.

Utilize `console.log` to check possible solutions for truthy and falsy values.

Don't try to run the code without adding a condition to the `if` statement. You'll get a syntax error for not having a value inside the `if () {` parentheses.

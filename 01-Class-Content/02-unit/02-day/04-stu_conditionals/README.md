# Conditionals

## Instructions:

Imagine you are building a website for a wine distributor. Legally you need to ask a user's age before you allow them into your site. 

Using a pencil and paper or a flowcharting software, design the following program:

1. A program that, when a user clicks a button, takes in a users age and checks to see if they are 21 or over. If they are, display "Welcome to our online store". Otherwise, display "You must be 21 or older to enter".

// Using the new DOM Manipulation library, do all of the following: 

// 1. Render all of the names in `studentList` individually in paragraph tags to the div with the class `content`.

// 2. When the add button is pressed, use the `val` function to get the value of the user input and and add that name to the list. Re-render the list. 

// 3. When the search button is pressed, add the `blue` class to the `body` if the name that was input is in the studentList array.

// 4. When the delete button is pressed, delete the element from studentList that matches the name the user entered in the input field. Re-render the list.

# SPA

## Instructions

Working off of the code you just saw, add new text to the `nav` area that says "Home". 

Add the JavaScript code to hide the `about` section and show the `homepage` section when the `Home` text is clicked. 

## Challenge:

Add a new "page" called contact with a contact form. 

Add a nav "Contact Us" to the `nav`. Hide all the other "pages" and display the contact form when the `Contact Us` text is clicked. 

Ensure that the contact form hides when any other navigation links are clicked.

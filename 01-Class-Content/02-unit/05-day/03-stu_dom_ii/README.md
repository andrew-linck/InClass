# DOM Manipulation Functions II

## Instructions

In this activity, we'll be refactoring the previous activity. 

Similar to the `text` function, change the `html` variable in `dom.js` to a function. 

1. The function should take in 1 parameter - a string that represents the html you want on the page. 

2. The `html` function should loop through every item in the nodeList and reset the `innerHTML` property to the new text.

3. Once you complete the above steps, use the `html` function in `app.js` to add 2 paragraphs to the elements with the class content.

# Function Drill Activity

**Instructions:**

Create a `index.js` and create all of the functions below. Don't forget to test as you go along to make sure your functions work properly! Don't worry about time, just get as far as you can! Remember, drills like these help to solidify concepts and challenge yourself.

1. Make a function that multiplies 2 numbers.
2. Make a function the adds two numbers.
3. Make a function that concatenates 2 strings.
4. Make a function that takes a string and returns true if the string has more than 5 characters or false if it doesn't.
5. Make a function that sums the elements in an array.
6. Make a function that takes in 2 numbers and outputs the larger of the two.
7. Make a function that returns the first letter of a string.
8. Make a function that converts Fahrenheit to Celsius. **HINT:** The equation for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius is `(F - 32)/1.8`

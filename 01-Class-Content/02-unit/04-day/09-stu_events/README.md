# Callbacks and Events

## Instructions

Open `index.html` and add your code into the provided script tag.

1. Use `document.querySelector()` to obtain a reference to the `#test` element.
2. Add an event listener that triggers `myFunction` when the mouse enters the `#test` element.

Be sure to open your console to see the display of your event listener.

## Challenge

Add an element in your HTML with an id of `display` and update this div's text when the event listener is triggered.

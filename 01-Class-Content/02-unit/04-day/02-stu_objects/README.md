# Objects Activity

## Instructions:

In this activity , you'll use objects to make an interactive phone book:

1. In the `index.js` file provided, start by adding more contacts to the `contacts` object.

2. `console.log` one person's phone number.

3. Next add a `prompt` that prompts the user for a name and store the response in a variable called `prop`

4. Use an `alert` to display the phone number associated with the name the user entered.

### Hint 

You may need to use bracket notation for this exercise.

## Challenge:

For each person in the `contacts` object, create a new object that will hold their phone number, address, and state of residency. Then `console.log` one person's address.

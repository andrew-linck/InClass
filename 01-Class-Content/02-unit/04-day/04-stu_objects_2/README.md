# Objects II Activity

## Instructions:

Add code for makeSound, sleep, and feed methods on the dog object.

1. Open index.html in your code editor and take a moment to example the starter code.

2. When makeSound is called, the object's sound property should be logged to the console using the this keyword.

3. When sleep is called, the object's isSleepy property should be set to false, and its isHungry property should be set to true. Use the this keyword to access both properties. Add a console log statement to explain to the user what's happening.

4. When feed is called, the object's isHungry property should be set to false, and its isSleepy property should be set to true. Use the this keyword to access both properties. Add a console log statement to explain to the user what's happening.

5. At each step remember to test your code in the console!

Refer back to the previous example if unsure about object methods!

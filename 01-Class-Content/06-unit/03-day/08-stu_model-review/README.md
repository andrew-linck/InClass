# Sequelize Models Activity

## Instructions:

Using the `Reservations` model as a guide, create a new model for the `waitingList` from the hot restaurant app. The `waitingList` model should contain the following properties:

* name
* phoneNumber
* email

Once you have this model created, create a second model to add a `staff` model to the hot restaurant app. This `staff` model should contain the following properties:

* name
* age
* hire date

Remember to set your `allowNull` and `default` fields appropriately!

Use the [sequelize documentation](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/manual/tutorial/models-definition.html#data-types) to use the appropriate data type for each field.

Once you have finished this, use the Sequelize documentation to read up on how you might create or modify data in your database using Sequelize.

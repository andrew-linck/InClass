# Sequelize Models Activity

## Instructions:

**Instructions:**

Using the reservations model as a guide, create a new model for the `waitingList` from the hot restaurant app. The `waitingList` model should contain the following properties:

* name
* phoneNumber
* email

Once you have finished this, discuss each file in this activity with your partner. Add comments to each line in the two models, the configuration file, and `app.js`.

# INSERT SQL Data

## Instructions

It is time to add some data into `projects_db`!

Try to add at least three rows of data to each table.

Use `SELECT * FROM <<table>>;` to verify that you've successfully inserted the data. Remember to modify the statement to replace `<<table>>` with the table you wish to query.

## Challenge

Modify your `SELECT` statement to select only one or two columns from a specified table.

Try to add a `WHERE` clause to your SQL `SELECT` statement to query data that matches a certain condition.

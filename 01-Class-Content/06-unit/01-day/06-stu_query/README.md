# SQL Querying

## Instructions

Using the `projects_db` database, update data in each of the three tables.

Rather than just changing one column at a time, update multiple columns in the same UPDATE statement. We haven't talked about this, but the syntax is very similar to SELECTing multiple columns.

## Challenge

Use the SELECT statement with the WHERE clause to find all customers whose company name starts with a "V".

# Flights Queries

## Instructions:

Your work on the flights webapp is progressing, but rather than simply using the airport code, you want to include the airport name for each flight. Write the below queries as a proof of concept.

1. Create a query to retrieve the flight number, airline, and source airport name for all flights for the airline, `Delta Airlines`.

2. Create a query to retrieve the flight number, airline, and destination airport city for all flights with the source airport code, `AKK`.

## Challenge:

3. Create a query to retrieve the flight number, airline, source airport name, and destination airport name for all flights in our database.

_HINT_: This will require you to use the `AS` keyword in SQL. You will also need an additional JOIN clause. You may have to Google to figure this out!

# Blogging Models

## Instructions

In the provided project, add two models, `Author` and `Article`.

Author should have the following properties:

* name
* email

Article should have the following properties:

* title
* body

Use whichever data types make the most sense. Do not worry about adding validation at this point. We're just creating the models for right now.

Once you have created the model, run the SQL statement below in Workbench to create the database, then start your server and confirm that your tables were created as expected.

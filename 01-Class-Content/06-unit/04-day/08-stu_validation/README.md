# Validation

## Instructions

Using the [sequelize documentation](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/manual/tutorial/models-definition.html#validations) as a guide, add validation to the models you created in the previous activity. This validation can be whatever you like, just be sure to add some sort of validation to each field.

Once you've added your validation, use Postman to make a test POST request to both `/api/authors` and `/api/articles`. Be sure to enter both invalid data and valid data to verify that your vaildation is working correctly.
